# Power_Spectra
Code for calculating auto and cross-spectra of sky maps.

Scripts for calculating auto and cross-spectra of sky maps. Performs Monte Carlo sims to estimate bandpower covariances.

Main file is pseudo_Cl.py, which should be run with an ini fil containing input parameters. This uses NaMaster for power spectrum estimation. pseudo_Cl_spice.py is currently being tested, uses PolSpice instead.
